>[!tip]+
> This project primarily demonstrates how to use [Slidev] within [Github Pages] for my friends.

- The version of Node.js I am using is v8.15.0.
- I recommend using `pnpm` pkm.
  - Pay attention to versions and dependency installation issues.
- Navigate to the 'src' directory of the corresponding slide and execute `pnpm run build`.
